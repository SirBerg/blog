Hi Y'all! I'm Sir Berg from Germany. This is my Blog where I'll talk about things that I like.
## Why a blog?
I feel like I need a bit of a creative outlet and a place to ramble about things from time to time.
So I thought I'd learn to use Astro and start to build a little blog where I can do just that.
## Who are you even?
If you are interested in that you may want to check out the [about page](/about).
## What are you going to blog about?
I'll use this blog to just write about things I like. In particular:
- Games
- Computer Stuff
- Programming  
<br />
As I'm not a professional Programmer there may not be as much programming stuff because sometimes I don't really feel
confident in giving my 2 cents

## Can I write a Blog Post?
Yes you can! You can create a Pull Request with your Article on the [Github Repository](https://github.com/SirBerg/blog).
I'll then review your article and put it up if I think it is okay to upload.

## Conclusion
I'm pretty excited to have a bit of a creative outlet and a way to talk about things I'm excited about.
